# Hail Data

This repo contains the iPython Notebooks used to parse the data from the [Alberta Hail Project Meteorological and Barge-Humphries Radar Archive](https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/dvn/dv/hail_data). The entire archive, metadata, and information about permissions can be found in the University of Alberta's Dataverse, accessed at the previous link.

The raw data used in this repo can be downloaded from [Dataverse](https://dataverse.library.ualberta.ca/dvn/dv/hail_data); the file extensions were changed from .DAT to .TXT using Automator on Mac (see image below). The .CSV files are a result of the code in the iPython notebooks (the files with the extension .IPYNB)

This data, code, and the resulting visualizations are part of a data rescue / reuse project and presentation by Sandra Schwab, Larry Laliberte, and Anna Bombak at the University of Alberta.

The map visualization can be found at http://mediagestalt.com/maps/hail.html.
